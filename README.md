# Congratulations, 🔗 Survivor 🏆 !

Welcome to **OnChain Survivor** Official Repository ! Congratulations on making it this far, You survived every hack, every rug, every fork and every twist in the crypto journey. 🚀💪 Keep pushing forward! 🌟🔥

 🌐🎮 The usage of AI in the development of this game is not just encouraged but considered mandatory. Fun, simplicity, decentralization, and openness are the foundational pillars of the project.

## 🌟About the Project🌟

Onchain Survivor is a web-based top-down survival game that utilizes AI in tanden with Web3 technologies to enable a new kind of browser gaming experience. Players will navigate an AI generated environment to do what they do best... Survive! Onchain Survivor aims to combine the addictive gameplay of roguelite games with the innovative potential of generative AI and blockchain technology, creating a unique and engaging experience. Enjoy a dynamic and challenging survival experience set within the exciting world of blockchains.

## The problem & the solution: The Challenger system, Blockchain Integration 🔗 & Game Design 🏟️

In the near future, players will be capable to create with all kinds of experiences with just one prompt using GenAI technology, being able to totally inmerse in virtual worlds beyond human imagination. this brings the problem of such beautiful generated experiences being "isolated" from the rest of their communities or peers, and this a problem blockchains actually can solve.

    C -->|Player Three prompt| F[Experience Z]
```

Onchain survivors uses the "Challenger System", in which a user sends a challenge into a queue of user generated challenges, utilizing blockchain technology to keep track of current and previous records. These challenges are essentially the main gameplay loop that will be executed during a day (around 7200 ethereum blocks). This means that all players will enjoy the same challenge! resulting in a more shared and consensus based generative experience. This Rank based auction system with periodic reset model, also gives chances for all players who sent challenges in the queue to eventually be able to set the game for a day!

## 🌌  Development Roadmap 🛠️ Future Vision: Fully AI-Generated Interactive Worlds 🌌

Onchain Survivor envisions a future where gameplay is entirely generated by AI, blurring the lines between player input and immersive generative experiences. Initially, currently a blend of human creativity and AI assists in producing game assets, but the long-term goal is to transition to systems capable of rendering interactive worlds in real-time based on user-defined prompts. 

This evolution begins with semi-autonomous tools such as neural style transfer and procedurally generated assets, progressively integrating more advanced AI capable of orchestrating gameplay dynamics, art, sound, and storytelling simultaneously. By leveraging blockchain technology to synchronize and preserve these experiences, the game ensures that players share a cohesive and decentralized narrative.

### 🥇 Phase 1 🥇: Daily Challenges, by players for players!

This  system allows users to add their challenges to the Challenge queue. The system is a queue, with each user placing their challenges aiming for the top positions on the leaderboard. The structure is dynamic and ONLY the number one in the queue becomes the main challenger for the next day!. 

**Setting Challenges**: Users submit challenges into the global queue. The challenge values determine the ranking, where the highest one of the day secures the first position and the game state, while the second-highest becomes the next in line, and so on until all ranks are fille,  ensuring opportunities for all participants.

**Daily Rank up**: Every n Blocks, the top-ranked challenge in the queue becomes the game state for the set period of time, making room for the second-highest to claim the number one spot. All other positions advance one spot too!

**Adding**: If the previous day's top-ranked in the Challenge Queue wants to secure the first rank again, they must re add with a higher amount to reclaim their position and set the game Challenge for consecutive days.

This system ensures fairness by regularly refreshing the queue, preventing any one user from monopolizing the top position.

### Phase 2: Multiple games, all using the same Challenge Queue!

As additional game "templates"  or models are developed and integrated into the main client in the future, they will all operate on the same underlying smart contract for the challenge queue. This means setting a challenge for one game will simultaneously apply to multiple games! I figured it would be a very fun experience to set a challenge for my favorite game, and see what kind of challenge gets generated across different other games. However, specific design constraints must be maintained to ensure the games remain coherent with one another trought the challenges.

### Phase 3: User generated real time experiences, from locally run neural networks. 

Currently, GenAI videos rendered on top of completed games offer a glimpse into the future of gaming and the styles of challenges in the game is done using typical computer graphics technologies, like custom shaders and materials. for Onchain survivor, Challengers will be able to choose an style and the general gameplay, then using fast style transfer technology, it will adapt it into the main gameplay loop by re-rendering each frame in real time as it is being executed, allowing Challengers to "modify" the game as they desire using these technologies, and have all the others survivors enjoy it too at the same time. Onchain Survivor plans to eventually (Realistically a couple of years)  implement wathever open-source, real-time technology becomes the most qualified for this job to enable this experience.

## 😈👺Onchain Survivor Dynamic Difficulty Scaling👺😈

The *Onchain Survivor Dynamic Difficulty Scaling function* will be satisfying gameplay up until minute 30. We'll assume the difficulty increases exponentially until the end. Depending on several accounting factors related to both the Players $P$ and the blockchain $B$. Let  $D(t)$  be the difficulty at time  $t$.   The final difficulty can be modeled as:

$D(t) = D_0 e^{kt} +α(Pavg​−P(t)+βB(t))$

where:

-   $D0$  is the initial difficulty at  $t=0$,
-   $k$  is a constant that determines the rate of difficulty increase.
-   $α$  is a scaling factor for the performance adjustment,
-   $Pavg​$  is the average expected performance,
-   $P(t)$  is the player's performance at time  $t$.
- $β$  is a scaling factor for the blockchain-derived difficulty,
- $B(t)$  is the difficulty factor extracted from the latest blockchain block.

Note:  Random difficulty factor $B(t)$ that is extracted from the latest block in the blockchain. The factor $B(t)$ could be based on various metrics from the blockchain, such as transaction volume, block size, or other relevant activities. The term $βB(t)$ allows the difficulty to adapt dynamically based on real-time blockchain data, adding an element of unpredictability and aligning with the decentralized nature of blockchain games. 

## Art Style 🎨 & Sound Design 🎵

Any kind of submissions are welcomed as long as they are coherent!, theres no dead set art and musical style being planned in the long term, so even if current version is being made in 3D with basic music, with the usage of neural style transfer for rendering in real time and AI generatic music in the future will allow for different styles to be applied. 

##  📚  Interaction Models 🕹️

As frictionless and simple as possible, No wallet required to play, the game's first priority is FUN. If the game is not fun then it will not be sustainable!

## 🚀Getting Started🚀 

Follow these steps to set up Onchain Survivor on your local machine:

### ⏱️Prerequisites⏱️
- Currently it should run in 4 years old hardware. Optimization is always an ongoing process, so please be patient. 

### 💿Installation💿
- Download the client, release and open index.html in your local server, or visit https://onchainsurvivor.pages.dev.

I expect In the future the game will not need a server as I will take take to tidy the code.

A Web3 Wallet is required to participate in the ranks!
