# Buried Ideas
This unordered list includes ideas scrapped during design or production. They are documented here to keep track of them and serve as a reference in case they are needed in the future.

## Onchain Execution, Ideal design of Onchain Survivor, fully descentralized vertical stack, Initial basic design 
The ideal final arquitectural design concept of executing the game entirely on-chain was scrapped. Instead, a new design was implemented where cryptographic proof ensures that the game client has not been tampered with. This approach maintains the integrity and security of the game while reducing the complexity and cost associated with full on-chain execution.
